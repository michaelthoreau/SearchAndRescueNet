# Satellite Imagery for Search And Rescue Dataset

This dataset was generated by volunteers searching for a missing paraglider wing in the Nevada desert. The dataset contains bounding box annotations:

| Set           | Images      | Annotations |
| -----------   | ----------- | ----------- |
| Train         | 1808        | 3048        |
| Validate      | 490         | 747         |
| Test          | 254         | 411         |
| Total         | 2552        |4206         |

This is a single class dataset (+ background), where the class is 'target'. Labelers were instructed to draw boxes around anything they suspect may be the missing paraglider. The paraglider wing was found, and is provided as an example below. The data is in the [COCO format](https://www.immersivelimit.com/tutorials/create-coco-annotations-from-scratch), and is directly compatible with faster r-cnn as implemented in Facebook's [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2).
